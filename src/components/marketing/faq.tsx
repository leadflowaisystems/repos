/**
 * THE QUESTIONS OWNERS ACTUALLY ASK.
 *
 * Each answer is a description of what the product does now, and each is
 * short enough to read standing up. Native <details>, so the page needs no
 * script for it and a keyboard or a screen reader gets the disclosure the
 * browser already knows how to announce.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: publish a price. There is no public price
 * list anywhere in Headway — what a business pays is agreed with it directly —
 * so the answer says how that happens instead of inventing a number.

const FAQ = [
  {
    q: 'Is the feedback public?',
    a: 'No. Feedback left through your QR card or link goes to your business’s team only. After they send it, every customer — happy or not — is offered your public review link if you have one. Headway never posts anything anywhere.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do customers need an app or an account?',
    a: 'No. They scan the code or open the link, and the page works in any phone browser. It takes about a minute, and nobody is asked for a name or a number.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What if I only have a few responses?',
    a: `Headway is useful from the first response: you see what each customer said, anything that repeats, and what Headway is watching. At ${PRODUCT_RULES.firstReadingAt} responses it gives a first read. It calls something a pattern only once at least ${PRODUCT_RULES.namedAt} customers raise it among ${PRODUCT_RULES.patternReadAt} or more responses. It shows a change over time only between two comparable sets of feedback that each hold at least ${PRODUCT_RULES.compareAt} responses — sets Headway draws by itself. It will not turn two comments into a trend.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Does Headway contact my customers?',
    a: 'No. Customers stay anonymous, Headway keeps no customer names or numbers, and it never sends messages to your customers.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which languages does it work in?',
    a: 'Customers can write in English, Hindi or Marathi. Your workspace can be read in English, हिन्दी or मराठी — you choose on your Account page.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does it cost?',
    a: 'Your workspace starts on a free trial, with no card and no payment page. When you want to carry on, press Continue with Headway on your Account page and the Headway team agrees the rest with you directly. Printed QR cards are ordered from your workspace, priced per card.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I stop, and have my data deleted?',
    a: 'Yes. Ask the Headway team and your business’s workspace — its feedback, its topics, its changes and everything else it stores — is deleted permanently.',
  },
